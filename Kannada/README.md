# learning-kannada

Hey people,

This is Piyush. I am native of Ranchi, a city in northern state of India and recently I shifted to Bangalore after getting my first internship here. Today it is 9th of June 2023 and it is approx 3 month here in Karnataka, 
and I think I must be here for few more time ( min 1 year more). So I have decided to use this time to challenge myself and learn the language of this land.

I am will be updating my growth here in this repo and also I will be using only publically available resources all of which will be updated here.

You can freely use of them them only for learning purpose but not for commercial.

Let's start the journey!!
